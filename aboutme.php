                Ever since I became a father, my passion has grown for creating engaging stories that teach 
children good morals and habits. Children are the leaders of tomorrow, starting them on a 
healthy diet of good morals and habits would go a long way in setting them up for the rest of 
their lives.
With strong African roots and values shaping me into who I am today, I give all thanks to my 
tribe, my family, my country, and my continent, Africa. These unique values which I call 
“Motherland Gems” which I was raised with I believe will give kids a chance to be the best form 
of who they are supposed to be.
Join me on my journey of spreading positivity through my books, articles etc. with the goal of 
having the next generation of emotionally conscious, empathetic, motivated, and most 
important happy children.

                My name is Teslim, I have a passion for writing and empowering people through my writing. I 
have always had a knack for writing fiction or instructive materials, writing became a passion in 
college where I wrote on student life blogs to help my fellow students navigate college life. 
Now, I write to empower as many people as I can. I’ve recently published my debut children’s 
book “The Shy Boy & The Scary Tree”, my goal with this book is to instill courage and 
confidence in children

that involves keeping the body and mind health
